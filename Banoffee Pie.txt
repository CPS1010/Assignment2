1.Put the crushed biscuit into a bowl with the melted butter. Mix it together thoroughly, then press the mixture into the base and sides of your tin. Chill for ten minutes. This will form the base of your easy banoffee pie.

2.Spread the caramel over the base. Just spread it out with a spoon or a spatula.

3.Slice the bananas and scatter them over the top, then put the cream on top and decorate with grated chocolate. Just keep it in the fridge until you’re ready.
