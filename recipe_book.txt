--Starters--
--Mushroom Soup--

Cut the mushrooms into slices.
Melt butter in large frying pan.
Add in onions, garlic, and mushrooms. 
Cook until onions are soft.

Blend in 2 tbsps. flour and stir.
Add in the chicken broth and heat until slightly thickened while stirring frequently.
Stir cream with additional 1 tbsp. flour and seasonings. Add in cream to soup. Heat to thicken while stirring frequently.

--Bruschetta--

1.Blanch and peel the tomatoes: Bring 2 quarts of water to a boil. As the water is heating make shallow cuts in a cross pattern at the tip ends of the tomatoes (this will make the tomatoes easier to peel).
Once the water is boiling, remove the pot from the heat. Put the tomatoes in the hot water and blanch for 1 minute.Remove with a slotted spoon and let sit until cool enough to handle. Then gently peel off the tomato skins. Cut out the stem base with a paring knife.
Cut the tomatoes into halves or quarters and squeeze out most of the juices and seeds.

2.Preheat oven to 450°F (230°C) with a rack in the top slot of the oven.

3.Chop tomatoes, toss them with garlic, olive oil, vinegar, basil, salt and pepper: Finely chop the tomatoes and place them in a medium bowl. Mix in the minced garlic, 1 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil, and the balsamic vinegar.
Stir in the thinly sliced basil and add salt and freshly ground black pepper, adding more to taste. Note, tomatoes love salt; you may need to add more than you expect.

4.Toast the baguette slices: Use a bread knife to slice the baguette on the diagonal making half-inch thick slices. Brush one side of each slice with olive oil (a pastry brush helps here) and place olive oil-side down on a baking sheet or roasting pan.
The baguette slices will toast best in the top rack of your oven, so you may need to work in batches to toast them all.
When the oven has reached 450°F (230°C) place the slices in the oven on the top rack and toast for 5 to 6 minutes until lightly browned around the edges.

5.Serve toasted bread with tomato mixture: Arrange the toasted bread on a platter, olive oil side facing up (the olive oil will help create a temporary barrier keeping the bread from getting soggy from the chopped tomatoes).
Either serve the toasts plain with a bowl of the tomato bruschetta mixture on the side for people to top their own, or use a spoon to gently top each toasted bread slice with some of the tomato mixture. If you top each slice individually, do it right before serving.

-----------MAIN COURSES-------------


----Pizza Norma----
Step 1:
On your kitchen surface mix the flour with the salt and make a well in the middle.

Step 2:
In a jug mix the yeast with "some" of the warm water and the sugar, whisk it using a fork and leave it there for few minutes.

Step 3.Pour it into the well;

Step 4:
Add the oil of olive and start kneading until you have a smooth, elastic and compact dough.

Step 5:
Keep adding the remaining water, little by little, letting it to be absorbed and give it the shape of a ball. 

Step 6:
Place the ball in a large bowl dusted with flour at the bottom, cover it with a cloth and let it rise in a warm place, far from airstreams, (like the oven for example) for at least an hour or until the dough has doubled in size.

Step 7:
While the pizza is rising, you can cut the aubergine/eggplant in slices and fry them in a pan filled with olive oil. Now it's time to roll out the pizza with your rolling pin. 

Step 8:
some more flour next to you and use it on the rolling pin so that the dough won't ruin or make holes. Choose the thickness according to your taste, then place it on a baking tray.

Step 9:
Heat the oven on 180°. Now we are ready to make our pizza!
Spread 2-3 table spoons of tomato sauce, few leaves of fresh basil in little pieces, cover all up with mozzarella cheese and place the fried aubergine/eggplant on top. Finally sprinkle with little grated parmesan cheese. Place in the oven for about 15 minutes, but if you have rolled out the dough quite thin, better to check after 10 minutes. 

----Vegetarian Risotto----
Step 1:
lace stock and 2 cups cold water in a saucepan over high heat.
Bring to the boil. Reduce heat to low. Simmer until needed.

Step 2:
Meanwhile, heat half the oil in a large, heavy-based saucepan over medium-high heat. Add chopped zucchini and tomatoes. Cook, stirring, for 2 to 3 minutes or until lightly browned. Transfer to a bowl. Heat remaining oil in pan. Add chopped onion and crushed garlic. Cook, stirring, for 2 minutes or until softened. Add rice. Cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add lemon juice. Bring to the boil.

Step 3:
Reduce heat to low. Add 1 ladle of stock mixture to rice. Cook, stirring with a wooden spoon, until liquid has absorbed. Repeat with remaining stock, 1 ladle at a time. Add vegetable mixture to rice mixture with last ladle of stock. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes or until rice is tender. Remove from heat. Stir in basil and cheese. Serve.

To make the icing: measure the cream and chocolate into a bowl and carefully melt over a pan of hot water over a low heat, or gently in the microwave for 1 min (600w microwave). Stir until melted, then set aside to cool a little and to thicken up.
To ice the cake: spread the apricot jam on the top of each cake. Spread half of the ganache icing on the top of the jam on one of the cakes, then lay the other cake on top, sandwiching them together.
Use the remaining ganache icing to ice the top of the cake in a swirl pattern. Dust with icing sugar to serve.
