--Tuna Dip--

1.In a medium bowl, combine tuna and cream cheese by mashing with a fork.

2.Add onion and lemon juice, reserving 1 teaspoon of juice. Season to taste and mix well.

3.Transfer to serving bowl. Chill until required. When ready to serve, drizzle reserved juice over and sprinkle with parsley.

--Mushroom Soup--

Cut the mushrooms into slices.
Melt butter in large frying pan.
Add in onions, garlic, and mushrooms. 
Cook until onions are soft.

Blend in 2 tbsps. flour and stir.
Add in the chicken broth and heat until slightly thickened while stirring frequently.
Stir cream with additional 1 tbsp. flour and seasonings. Add in cream to soup. Heat to thicken while stirring frequently.

--Bruschetta--

1.Blanch and peel the tomatoes: Bring 2 quarts of water to a boil. As the water is heating make shallow cuts in a cross pattern at the tip ends of the tomatoes (this will make the tomatoes easier to peel).
Once the water is boiling, remove the pot from the heat. Put the tomatoes in the hot water and blanch for 1 minute.Remove with a slotted spoon and let sit until cool enough to handle. Then gently peel off the tomato skins. Cut out the stem base with a paring knife.
Cut the tomatoes into halves or quarters and squeeze out most of the juices and seeds.

2.Preheat oven to 450°F (230°C) with a rack in the top slot of the oven.

3.Chop tomatoes, toss them with garlic, olive oil, vinegar, basil, salt and pepper: Finely chop the tomatoes and place them in a medium bowl. Mix in the minced garlic, 1 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil, and the balsamic vinegar.
Stir in the thinly sliced basil and add salt and freshly ground black pepper, adding more to taste. Note, tomatoes love salt; you may need to add more than you expect.

4.Toast the baguette slices: Use a bread knife to slice the baguette on the diagonal making half-inch thick slices. Brush one side of each slice with olive oil (a pastry brush helps here) and place olive oil-side down on a baking sheet or roasting pan.
The baguette slices will toast best in the top rack of your oven, so you may need to work in batches to toast them all.
When the oven has reached 450°F (230°C) place the slices in the oven on the top rack and toast for 5 to 6 minutes until lightly browned around the edges.

5.Serve toasted bread with tomato mixture: Arrange the toasted bread on a platter, olive oil side facing up (the olive oil will help create a temporary barrier keeping the bread from getting soggy from the chopped tomatoes).
Either serve the toasts plain with a bowl of the tomato bruschetta mixture on the side for people to top their own, or use a spoon to gently top each toasted bread slice with some of the tomato mixture. If you top each slice individually, do it right before serving.

—DESSERTS—
N0#1: Lemon Cheesecake

Method:

1.To make the base crush biscuits, melt butter in saucepan, take off heat and stir in brown sugar and biscuit crumbs
2.Press into an 8 inch loose bottomed cake tin, chill in fridge while making the topping
3.Beat together the cream cheese, castor sugar, lemon zest and lemon juice until smooth and creamy
4.Spread over the base and chill for a couple of hours.

N0#2: Chocolate Cake
 
Method:
Preheat the oven to 180C, gas 4.
Beat together the eggs, flour, caster sugar, butter and baking powder until smooth in a large mixing bowl.
Put the cocoa in separate mixing bowl, and add the water a little at a time to make a stiff paste. Add to the cake mixture.
Turn into the prepared tins, level the top and bake in the preheated oven for about 20-25 mins, or until shrinking away from the sides of the tin and springy to the touch.
Leave to cool in the tin, then turn on to a wire rack to become completely cold before icing.
To make the icing: measure the cream and chocolate into a bowl and carefully melt over a pan of hot water over a low heat, or gently in the microwave for 1 min (600w microwave). Stir until melted, then set aside to cool a little and to thicken up.
To ice the cake: spread the apricot jam on the top of each cake. Spread half of the ganache icing on the top of the jam on one of the cakes, then lay the other cake on top, sandwiching them together.
Use the remaining ganache icing to ice the top of the cake in a swirl pattern. Dust with icing sugar to serve.

N0#3: Banoffee Pie

Method:

1.Put the crushed biscuit into a bowl with the melted butter. Mix it together thoroughly, then press the mixture into the base and sides of your tin. Chill for ten minutes. This will form the base of your easy banoffee pie.

2.Spread the caramel over the base. Just spread it out with a spoon or a spatula.

3.Slice the bananas and scatter them over the top, then put the cream on top and decorate with grated chocolate. Just keep it in the fridge until you’re ready.
