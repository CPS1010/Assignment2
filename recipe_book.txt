----Main #1:Pizza Primavera----
1:Stir the yeast in warm water in a bowl, add the sugar and leave to sit for about 5 minutes until the mixture is a bit bubbly. Stir in the olive oil. Mix the salt with the flour in a large bowl, add the yeast mixture and knead until a smooth and elastic dough is formed. (I prefer to do this on a clean floured surface rather than in a bowl).
2:Return the dough to the bowl and coat lightly with a drizzle of olive oil. Let it rise for about an hour, until it has doubled in size.
3:Punch the dough down and roll ourt to preferred size and thickness. Bake in a preheated oven for about 5 minutes before adding the topping.
4:Cover the dough with the tomato puree but leave about half an inch around the edge. Cover with mozzarella and sprinkle with some oregano. Cut the sausage and the cheeslet in thick slices and spread around together with the whole olives and sun dried tomatoes. Sprinkle with some freshly ground black pepper (do not add salt since the sausage is quite salty).
5: Bake for about 20 minutes (200 oC fan forced) or until the edges of the pizza are golden brown.
----Main #2:Spaghetti Bolognese----
1.Heat the SuperValu Oil in a frying pan.
2.Add carrot, onion and cook for 5 mins to soften.

7.Reserve some of the cooking water, drain and pour the pasta into the pan along with the sauce.
8.Toss together, thinning with pasta water, if needed, and serve with the extra basil leaves with Parmesan shavings on top.
----Main #3:Pizza Norma---- 
1:On your kitchen surface mix the flour with the salt and make a well in the middle.
2:In a jug mix the yeast with "some" of the warm water and the sugar, whisk it using a fork and leave it there for few minutes.
3.Pour it into the well;
4:Add the oil of olive and start kneading until you have a smooth, elastic and compact dough.
5:Keep adding the remaining water, little by little, letting it to be absorbed and give it the shape of a ball. 
6:Place the ball in a large bowl dusted with flour at the bottom, cover it with a cloth and let it rise in a warm place, far from airstreams, (like the oven for example) for at least an hour or until the dough has doubled in size.
7:While the pizza is rising, you can cut the aubergine/eggplant in slices and fry them in a pan filled with olive oil. Now it's time to roll out the pizza with your rolling pin. 
8:some more flour next to you and use it on the rolling pin so that the dough won't ruin or make holes. Choose the thickness according to your taste, then place it on a baking tray.
9:Heat the oven on 180°. Now we are ready to make our pizza!
Spread 2-3 table spoons of tomato sauce, few leaves of fresh basil in little pieces, cover all up with mozzarella cheese and place the fried aubergine/eggplant on top. Finally sprinkle with little grated parmesan cheese. Place in the oven for about 15 minutes, but if you have rolled out the dough quite thin, better to check after 10 minutes.
